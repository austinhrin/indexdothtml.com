Why do you want to bloat your website with 100's of KB of code from frameworks when the solution is less than 1 KB. In most cases it is under half of that. The more your users have to download to their computer or phone impacts the performance of the website. If your users have to wait for the website to download and wait for the JavaScript and CSS to render they will leave. The longer they have to wait the more fed up they will get and leave."

Mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be more valuable to both you and employers instead of knowing basic knowledge of them and basic knowledge of say jQuery, Bootstrap, and Vue.js.
