Run `python dev_server.py` for development and when you build your files.
Run `python build.py` to build your files.

The development server runs on port 5000 and test build runs on 5001.

# To Do
- [ ] create a way to bundle html, css, javascript, and images to be uploaded on the server. Should compress images and code, remove extra spacing, remove line breaks, etc.
- [ ] create a way to generate sitemap.xml
- [ ] embed projects into page so they are more uniform to the website instead of opening in a new tab. Project would open a new page where it has a title and description at the top of the page and an iframe underneath with the project.
- [ ] embed fiverr gigs anywhere mixed in with the projects.
- [ ] add highschool/college website projects to page.
- [ ] call to action?
- [ ] about page should include what the website is about, about me (Austin), links to github, linkedin, other websites, etc.
- [ ] add links to github, linkedin, etc in the footer with icons next to each of them.
- [x] create a favicon.ico maybe just a simple icon that like </>
- [x] align blog post page and blog post list page to left and add an area to the right for an amazon ad
- [ ] add google analytics
